The source code of the last version of Gensokyo DLC has been preserved for archival purposes. Keep in mind that Byakuren no longer functions properly and multiplayer compatability is nonexistant. The only code that remains salvageable are the IL edits for some Gensokyo bosses, Byakuren's weapon drops, and boss rush to some extent. If you want the boss code, please consider looking at Anathema Mod's source code as it contains the lastest version of a fully functioning boss AI that supports multiplayer.

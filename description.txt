Team Fortress 2 is a pretty cool mod, it is one of the Terraria mods ever.

Features:
	Weapons from TF2
	NPCs
	Accessories
	Tools to help destroy Gensokyo
	Ignore the previous line

Future Features:
	More weapons
	More bosses

Cross Mod Content:
	Adds post-Moon Lord progression for the Calamity Mod.
	Has incredible synergy with the Gensokyo mod. It's highly recommended to combine both mods together.
